# robust-trip-planner

This repository implements an uncertainty aware trip planner. In other words the user may select with which certainty he wants to arrive at a desired location and time. It works in all of Switzerland and is built on top of [OpenTripPlanner](https://github.com/opentripplanner/OpenTripPlanner). For the rest, the jupyter notebook should speak for itself.
